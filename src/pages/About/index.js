            My most recent work stint was with Sprinklr where I designed for some of its core offerings like Social Media Engagement, Social Advertising, Care support and Analytics for big brands with a global reach that helped integrate all their social marketing needs under one roof. Having led the design team for four years in this young, rapidly growing enterprise startup environment - taught me how to balance business goals and engineering constraints as I unrelentingly advocated for the user.

            <p>I graduated from Symbiosis Institute of Design, India with a degree in User Experience Design. 
              I loved the human-centered design methods and processes I learned in school and applied them to 
              my thesis project with Microsoft R&D, Hyderabad
              I grew up in 7 different states in India and my ability to quickly adjust to new challenges in 
              life comes from that. Owing to my diverse upbringing, I embrace all cultures and try to bring it 
              to the designs I create. I am a movie buff and thereâ€™s nothing like relaxing to a good masala Bollywood movie. Food is my second love and I let my nose guide me to the pleasures of the stomach once every weekend.</p>
